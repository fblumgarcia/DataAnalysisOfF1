I am an enthusiast in Formula 1, also I browsed the F1's website and I found information of drivers standings from F1 was regularize in 1950 to last championship in 2021. Moreover, I love the world of data science and I did courses in Platzi in the school of Data scientist and Artifical Intelligence. For these reason I decided download all of this information, organize, clean, investigate more about this amazing sport and made this presentation to express my ideas, conclusions. I wish that you enjoy this.
